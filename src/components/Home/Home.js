            In todayâ€™s modern world, many of our systems and customs seem to be
            organized in a way that separates the different facets of health-
            for example, a nutritionist might recommend ways to eat healthfully,
            and a therapist might recommend ways to cope with stress, but often,
            there is little to no crossover guidance, or framework for fitting
            the pieces together as a whole.
