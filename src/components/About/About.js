          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
            <b>Medify</b> is a dream that turned into a tech based startup, a
            business with a great purpose to create positive impacts in peoples'
            lives. It is the first online doctor appointment service platform in
            Bangladesh, providing real time doctor information and appointments
            through a fully integrated system. <b>Medify</b> is missioned to
            bring convenience in the healthcare service delivery for the general
            people in Bangladesh.
          </p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The business was founded with a strong will to solve a real problem
            that impacts many in the country. The thought was kindled by the
            observation that people living in places beyond the major cities
            face tremendous troubles in finding a right doctor at the right time
            and subsequently suffer in securing treatment when they need it.
            Bangladesh is making significant progresses in many areas.
            Information technology, without any doubt has been instrumental in
            the transformation of people's way of doing things. We have seen
            bus, train or launch tickets being bought online. Online freelancing
            bringing new skills, confidence and earnings to thousands of youths.
            Noticeable boost in the e-commerce. Use of mobile money making lives
            better. Ironically, despite of being one of the most essential
            services, healthcare has not been focused with similar initiatives
            yet. There are still roadblocks disrupting smooth healthcare
            delivery even today. And, information technology has rarely been
            called up to effectively contribute in the sector.
          </p>
          <h4>Evolution into a Service Platform</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            The idea of <b>Medify</b> evolved into a service platform in early
            2014. It was not what it is today in the initial days. It started as
            a doctor's directory along with a feature for appointment requests.
            After realizing that only accomplishing appointment bookings will
            not help much, the whole vision was revisited. We needed to offer
            more. We needed to build and maintain relationships with the
            patients and doctors to ensure smoother connection for the service.
            We needed to add new features and extend the whole platform to
            accommodate many things that people will never see working as the
            back office. <b>Medify</b> understands the individuality of each
            patient and their problem. The platform is capable of maintaining
            records of queries, appointments, visits and visit outcomes. With
            the aid of a huge knowledge base built and maintained within the
            platform,
            <b>Medify</b> can follow up and take extended care of their users
            for their unique problems. Further, for ensuring real time
            availability of the doctors at their chambers, a dedicated team
            constantly engages with the hospitals, clinics and chambers'
            management.
          </p>
          <h4>Changing Mindsets</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            <b>Medify</b> aims to drive two very important behavioral changes
            that can make approaching treatment faster and better. In general, a
            common person in our country is quite unwilling to see a proper
            physician for his or her illness, until it gets too bad. People try
            out different suggestions from friends around them or conduct a self
            treatment based on other's experiences. This is mainly due to
            serious lack of awareness about the signs, symptoms, consequences of
            diseases and lack of proper guidance. Secondly, when people want to
            approach treatment, they commonly get into the trouble of finding a
            right doctor. In most cases, they head to Dhaka or other big cities
            and ask their relatives or friends for help. Unfortunately, those
            relatives or friends typically know only a few doctor names. Those
            are generally the busiest doctors who are well known at the national
            level. Certainly, taking an appointment of those doctors are quite a
            hassle. One may need to wait even two-three months to consult the
            doctor. This is again mainly because, there is not enough awareness
            about the availability of many qualified doctors across the country
            who could give attention and treat the patient earlier than the time
            he/she will wait for. These result in unnecessary delays aggravating
            the condition of the disease. <b>Medify</b> through its social
            network platform and many other means is continuously engaging to
            build the awareness among people to help these improve.
          </p>
          <h4>Expansion with Impact</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            If we are to truly improve this with the right impact, we must focus
            on the people at the rural or in small cities. Providing and
            extending this service to the rural people of Bangladesh requires a
            lot of resources and activities. And, it isn't easy with the limited
            resources.
          </p>
          <h4>Present Operation</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            Since the official launching on 31st October 2015, <b>Medify</b> is
            operational with full capacity in regard to providing appointments
            from doctors around the country. The service hosts information and
            appointment facilities for more than 9615 doctors from 556
            consultation centers in 63 districts. We have served a few thousand
            patients so far and have been able to bring smiles on their faces.
          </p>
          <h4>The Future</h4>
          <hr />
          <p>
            At <b>Medify</b>, we are confident to make a difference in how
            people of Bangladesh approach healthcare services. We have plans to
            integrate many other related services with the doctors' appointment
            in the platform in coming days. The investment from BD Venture has
            given the initiative more speed. Now, it's all about execution of
            the dreams to bring goodness out for everyone in the country.
